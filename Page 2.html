                        <h5>What are succulents?</h5>
                        <p>Succulent plants, or succulents, are a collection of plants that have water storage tissues. Succulent plants are drought resistant plants. They have adapted to survive very dry, arid conditions. These plants typically store water in their leaves, their stems, or their roots.
                            The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning juice or sap. Their leaves tend to be fleshy, plump and thick to conserve water and to help minimize water loss.

                        <h5>Are Cacti Succulents?</h5>
                        <p>Cacti and succulents are sometimes grouped together and sometimes separately, which can lead to some confusion. A cactus or cacti are a unique subset of the succulent group. The cactus family, or Cactaceae, is one of the largest families of succulents in the world. The word cactus is derived from the Greek word kaktos, meaning spiny plant. Cacti are fleshy plants that store water, making them part of the succulent group. This group of plants are remarkable for their fleshy stems which serve to store water, prickly or hairy coating, and very few, or rarely any leaves. Due to these unique characteristics, you can almost easily identify a cactus just by their appearance. Generally speaking, all cacti are considered succulents but not all succulents are considered cacti. However, definitions and terminologies may vary depending on where you get your source of information. Horticulturists regularly excludes cacti from the succulent group. But for the majority of us succulent lovers or those who grow succulents as a hobby, these differences in definitions and classifications are not of major significance.

                        <h5>Where are they from?</h5>
                        Succulents are found all over the world in their natural habitats. They have a wide and rich range of habitats and are often found in environments that would otherwise be uninhabited. Most come from dry areas, deserts and semi-deserts ranging from Africa to North and South America; still others are found in mountainous regions and rain forests. Conditions that are normally too harsh for other plants to survive, such as high temperatures and low precipitation have made these plants extremely hardy and adaptable. Some succulents are also naturally found in sea coasts and dry lakes, which can be detrimental to other plant species because of their extreme levels of dissolved minerals.

                    <h5>Watering Cactus and Succulants</h5>
                    <p>Watering is one of the most important aspects of succulent care. Knowing when and how to water your succulents are keys to their survival. Overwatering is one of the easiest ways to accidentally kill your succulents due to their susceptibility to root rot, which is caused by damp roots. It is also dangerous to leave the plant completely dry for long periods of time, as the roots will start to die back.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h5>How often do you need to water Indoor Succulants?</h5>
                    <p>One of the most dangerous things for your indoor succulents is watering them incorrectly. Succulents hold moisture in their leaves, stems and tissues. They use these stored water to survive in dry conditions. Too much water is deadly to these plants. But they still need to be watered in order to survive and thrive. Leaving them too dry for too long can also cause their roots to die. The best way to determine when to water is to examine the soil and feel for moisture. Do not just touch the surface of the soil, but the top inch of the soil needs to be dry to the touch before you water your plant.<br>

                        How much and when you water also depends on the season. During the growing season, usually from spring to fall when growth is most active, water the plants thoroughly until some of the water begins to drain out of the holes of the pot (this may not happen with all potted pots). Sometimes, the water does not drain out of the pot but as long as you gave it a good drink of water, it should be fine. Make sure not to let the water collect in saucers. Pour out those excess water that collected in saucers. Allowing the water to drain out is good for the plants as it helps prevent root rot and it also prevents dissolved salts from accumulating in the soil. For most indoor potted plants, watering about once every ten to fourteen days during the active growing season should be sufficient.<br>
                        
                        During the inactive season (usually in winter time for most succulents), when the plant is dormant, water less frequently and less thoroughly. Check the soil for moisture and water only when the plant is dry to the touch but not completely bone-dry. Water only to moisten but not soak the plant. During the inactive months, the general rule is to water about once every three to four weeks. Pay attention to how your plants look. If they start looking shriveled between waterings, you may need to water them more often. If unsure in the beginning, water the plants lightly. It is better to under water than to over water until you figure out the ideal watering needs of your plants.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h5>Watering Succulants in pots and containers without drainage holes</h5>
                    <p>Some people advise against using containers without drainage holes for succulents. The reason being is that succulents do not like to sit in water. Having drainage holes allows excess water to drain out of the pots preventing root rot. You might be tempted to use a container without drainage holes because you like how it looks or you need to use it for a particular project. Whatever the reason, a container without any drainage holes is possible to use, but watering will be extra tricky because there is more possibility of overwatering and drowning your plants.<br>

                        If you have containers without drainage holes in them, you need to pay extra care and attention when watering your succulents. Allow plants to dry out in between waterings and feel the soil for moisture. The top inch of the soil needs to feel dry to the touch before you water. Remember that excess water cannot drain out of the holes so go easy on watering. Using a syringe, a spray bottle, or squeeze bottle will help control the amount of water you put into the containers. When using a spray bottle, make sure to spray the soil or medium instead of just the top of the plant. You want the water to get to the roots where it is absorbed by the plant and not just mist the plant from the surface. Watering frequency also depends on the growing season and size of your container. During the dry season or growing season, plants need more water. During the inactive growing season or when it’s cooler, water less frequently. The size of your container also determines how often and how much to water. Smaller containers hold less moisture than larger containers.<br>
                        
                        If unsure in the beginning, water the plants lightly and adjust as needed. It is better to under water than to over water until you get the hang of watering your plants in containers without drainage holes. If you accidentally pour too much water, you can get rid of the excess moisture by using a dry towel to dab the water. You can also pour excess water out carefully. Watering should be monitored closely when using these types of pots.</p>

                                    <h6>Shriveling or puckering of leaves</h6>
                                    <p>Succulents are known for their plump and fleshy leaves. The plant will start to shrivel and pucker, often from the lower leaves first. As the plant uses up all its stored water from the tissues, the shriveling will spread to the top of the plant. They will also look dehydrated and feel dry.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Leaves feel flat</h6>
                                    <p>Succulents that are underwatered have flattened, soft leaves. You can feel the leaves and squeeze them. If the leaves feel flat, soft and dry, then they are literally dehydrated and need more water.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Discoloring</h6>
                                    <p>Underwatered plants may also start changing colors. They may darken or begin to yellow. Along with shriveled leaves and discoloration, these are tell-tale signs that it is time to water your plants or to increase frequency and amount of watering.</p>

                                    <p>Overwatered plants look wilted and also shrivel, which may confuse others into thinking they need more water. Usually if the plants look green, the soil is wet, and you know your plant is well-watered, then you are overwatering and not underwatering your plants.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>Feel the leaves to see if they are flat or firm. If you see shriveling but the leaves still feel plump and hard, then the plant is most likely getting too much water.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>When the leaves start turning brown or yellow, it is often a sign that something is wrong with the plant. If you notice the leaves of your plants turning brown and yellow, along with wilting and falling leaves, these are often signs that you need to adjust your watering frequecny. If you know your plants are well-watered, they might actually be getting too much water.</p>

                                    <p>Another sign of overwatering is when your plant starts becoming mushy from too much water. The plants have literally absorbed too much water and cannot take in anymore. They blow up and burst and turn into mush.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    <p>Succulents are susceptible to root rot. Root rot occurs when the plant is constantly exposed to too much moisture and the roots begin to decay. Fungal disease sets in and cause the plant to wilt and die. You may notice your plant dropping all of its leaves and looking unwell. If you suspect root rot, remove the plant from the pot and soil and inspect the roots. If the roots appear mushy or slimy and grey or black, root rot may have set in from overwatering.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Sunlight</h5>
                            <p>Succulents and cacti need a certain amount of sunlight to thrive. Plants grow by absorbing light and turning it into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Providing adequate light, when growing succulents indoors, can be particularly challenging and may need some experimentation on your part. If these plants do not receive adequate light, they do not grow properly. Overtime, succulents that do not receive enough light become weak, distorted and discolored. When not exposed to adequate light they start etoliating or stretching out to look for the sun.
                                So are succulents and cacti able to thrive inside? Yes. We see proof of this by the numerous succulent species that have become highly adapted to living indoors and have become very popular houseplants. Any succulent species can be kept alive indoors, but this environment may limit the way they typically grow and flourish.
                                Light, and receiving proper lighting, is one of the most important things to consider when growing your plants, especially indoors. When growing indoors, take into consideration the available spots and locations in your house where you can place your plants and consider the type of plant you have, its origin and light requirements to figure out where to best place your plant. Consider the amount of sun and they type of lighting the location receives throughout the day. Ideally, you want to look for a location that will give your plants enough light as well as consistent light. Indoor lighting vary depending on the amount of sunlight you get. Direct natural sunlight coming through a window is not as strong as direct sunlight outside. And the intensity of the light the plants will receive lessens the further you move it away from a window.</p>

                                    <strong><u>Bright - </u></strong>When we refer to bright light it means there are no curtains, blinds or drapes between the plant and the window. On the other side of the window, there is nothing obstructing the light from coming through the window such as a tree, a shrub or a sign. Bright light means the plant needs to be placed in a sunny location, possibly southern or western facing windows with bright, direct light throughout the day.

                                <li>
                                    <strong><u>Filtered - </u></strong>Filtered light or indirect light means bright light that is not direct, or partially screened and lightly shaded sunlight. Plants that need filtered light need bright sun exposure, preferably a few hours of morning or late afternoon sun. Generally, filtered sunlight means that the plant needs a south or east facing window. Growing your plants in filtered sun will ensure adequate sun exposure without being over exposed to sunlight.

                                    <strong><u>Shady - </u></strong>or Low light means no direct sun or other light. The light that comes through the window is blocked by an outdoor tree, a building or other objects indoors such as curtains or furnitures. Typically, plants that need shady areas also need high humidity.

                                    <p>Although succulents retain moisture well, they do still need moderate to regular watering, at least once a week or a deep soaking every few weeks during the growing season. But too much water will cause the roots to develop black stem rot, so the trick is finding a growing medium that drains quickly and dries out completely between watering. Succulents do best with soil that is normally considered poor, filled with inorganic elements, as opposed to one rich in organic material.</p>

                                    <h6>Organic and Inorganic Elemets</h6>
                                    <p>Despite their need for well-draining soil, succulents do need some nutrients that organic elements provide. Some gardeners recommends a mix of 1 part garden soil, 1 part sand and 1 part peat moss or a mixture of 1 part potting soil and 1 part perlite. Other gardeners avoid potting mixes containing peat, remove any wood and twigs from the mix and add a coarse, gritty type of sand to potting soil.

                                    <p>Using sand, pumice, decomposed granite or perlite as the inorganic element in your succulent growing medium is less important than simply ensuring that the soil crumbles easily and lets water flow quickly through. If your soil falls apart after you wet it and give it a squeeze, it has the right components. If it remains formed into a lump, it needs more inorganic elements added to the mix.

                            <h5>Potting Succulants and Cactus</h5>
                            <p>If you’re trying to grow and cultivate your own green thumb, succulents are a great starting point. You won’t find any plants better adapted for growing in pots. Most succulents are native to arid regions and store water in their fleshy leaves, stems, and roots, enabling them to resist drought. This means they do not need to be fussed over with frequent watering, so you can go ahead and enjoy a weeklong summer vacation without giving them a second thought. Plus, their funky shapes and diverse varieties make growing them truly fun. Learn how to make a diverse succulent container arrangement in four easy steps.
                            </p>
                            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Step One</h6>
                                    <p>First, go to the garden center and purchase a variety of succulents in an array colors and shapes. For this container, we purchased 6; depending on the container’s size, you may need more or less (find a list of common succulents on slide 4). You can find the soil, gravel, and container at the garden center as well. When you get back to your home, full the wide, shallow dish three-quarters full with potting mix, and then cover the top with gravel. Succulents don’t need a lot of root space, as they store most of their water and nutrients in their leaves. Gravel helps the soil drain; steer clear of sand, because it can become too compact and lead to root rot.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Step Two</h6>
                                    <p>Blend the soil and gravel thoroughly, and moisten with water. New plantings should be watered well – but only once. The water will settle the soil. But if you water them too much, you will cause them to die from overwatering. When you give a succulent too much water, it will fill up its water storage tissues to a point of damage. You will know if your succulent is overwatered by its overly puffy-looking stems and leaves, and a general look of unhealthiness. Overwatering leads to root rot, which can kill your succulent. And we are trying to plant live succulents, here.</p>

                                <li>
                                    <h6>Step Three</h6>
                                    <p>Remove the plants from their nursery containers, and plant the largest one on one side of the pot. Surround it with the other plants, clustering similar shapes together. Some common succulent types include:
                                        Echeveria – The crown jewels of all rosette-forming succulents, this type can be found in a variety of colors
                                        Sedum (stonecrop) – These flat-lying succulents are perfect for trailing out from the edge of containers.
                                        Aeonium – Although they come in a variety of colors, we love these fleshy, long-leaved rosettes in lemon yellow<br>
                                    <strong>These are the most common succulants!</strong></p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h6>Step Four</h6>
                         
                                    <p>Sprinkle dark-colored aquarium gravel around each plant so that the soil is covered.
                                        To care for your succulent container garden and prevent root rot, let the soil dry out completely before watering again. Succulents thrive in well-drained soil, but require more water in the early spring when the plant is growing and less during the summer and winter. During the winter, succulents enter a dormant period. You may only need to water your succulents as infrequently as once per month during the winter, and as much as once/week during the springtime growing period (but only when the soil is dry). Keep your succulent container in a place that it is exposed as much sun as possible.
                                        </p>

                    <p class="pt1">Burro's tail or donkey's tail (Sedum morganianum) is a trailing succulent that looks best in a hanging basket or container sitting on a ledge, shelf, or plant stand so it can drape over. Each stem can reach up to three feet long and is packed with gray-green leaves about the size and shape of a plump grain of rice. The leaves have a pale sheen on them that wipes off when you touch them so it will show your fingerprints. Also, the leaves are fragile, falling off easily so it's best to avoid  handling this plant as much as possible. Native to Mexico, burro's tail prefers bright light for best performance. You can let the soil dry out between waterings, especially in winter when it isn't growing as actively.</p>

                    <p>Unlike other cacti, the Christmas cactus (Schlumbergera x buckleyi) doesn't have sharp spines. Its flat, fleshy, segmented stems can reach a couple feet in length, often draping over in a way that earned it the nickname, crab claw cactus. It also prefers a bit more moisture than its spiky kin, so water whenever the top inch of soil in its container is dry. But if you forget to water for a while, it will bounce back easily from a little drying out. Keep it in bright light near a window, and this plant will likely reward you by blooming in winter. And if it blooms a little earlier than you expect and the stem segments are spiky instead of scalloped, you might actually have a Thanksgiving cactus (they're closely related to Christmas cacti), but the care instructions are similar for both.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/hens.jpg" class="plant-ex" height="300px" alt="loading...">
                    <p>Two succulent plants share the common name of hens-and-chicks. They're closely related but look a little different. Both produce "chicks"—small, identical plants that are slightly offset from the mother (the hen). Echeveria elegans such as Mexican Snow Ball ($13, Etsy) forms flat, flowerlike rosettes with rounded edges and grows arching, bell-shape blooms every year. Sempervivum tectorum such as this hens-and-chicks collection ($21, Walmart) also forms rosettes, but each leaf tends to be flatter and more pointed. It has tiny, star-shape flowers. Both of these succulents come in all sorts of varieties that offer interesting shapes and colors, so they are especially fun to collect.<br>
                        Echeveria and Sempervivum have similar needs when they're grown as houseplants. Both should be allowed to dry slightly between waterings because constant moisture often causes their stems and roots to rot. They'll do best in bright light near a window. You can easily propagate these succulents by removing the chicks and placing them in their own container, but make sure to use a sandy potting mix labeled for cacti and succulents so your plants will have the drainage they need.

                    <img src="assets/img/jade.jpg" class="plant-ex" height="300px" alt="loading...">
                    <p>The jade plant (Crassula ovata) is an old-fashioned favorite for a reason: It's a cinch to grow! This long-lived South African native grows stocky, branched stems with thick, glossy green leaves sometimes tinged with red around the edges when grown in full sun. Some varieties have different-looking leaves, such as the variety 'Gollum' with leaves that resemble green monster fingers. Over time, jade plants can get several feet tall, but when grown as a houseplant, they usually stay about a foot tall. They can get a bit top-heavy, so it's a good idea to plant them in a heavier container like terra-cotta. The key to keeping a jade plant happy is to let the soil dry completely between waterings. Some gardeners only water jade when the leaves start to pucker or lose their shine, but these are signs that the plant is already stressed; if you wait that long, it might start to drop leaves.</p>

                    <p>Aloe vera grows as a cluster of long, slender leaves on a short stem. Over time, it produces more clusters of leaves called offsets that can form a colony large enough to fill the whole container. It's easy to divide them and move to other pots when things get too crowded. And while aloe vera might be most well-known for its healing sap used for centuries to treat wounds and sunburn, it does have sharp "teeth" along its leaf edges that can cut an unsuspecting passerby, so handle with care. Aloe vera is a forgiving, easy-to-grow houseplant that's tough to kill. Like other succulents, it prefers being kept on the drier side rather than having constantly damp soil. And while it does best in bright light, if you were to suddenly move it into a hot, sunny window, its leaves can get burned.</p>
