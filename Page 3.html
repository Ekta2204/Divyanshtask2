                        <h5>Natural History of the Air Plant</h5>
                        <p>Air plants are a group of very unique, bromeliad plants that do not require soil to grow as long as they are attached to another plant. They are considered an epiphyte, which is a plant that harmlessly grows on another, larger plant, most often a tree. You can even go more specific and call it an aerophyte, which is a plant that exclusively gets its nutrients from rain and air while growing on another plant in a non-parasitic manner.<br>

                            These plants are native to the tropical and arid regions of North, Central and South America. These plants can be found from dry deserts to tropical rainforests. They are very sensitive to frost-bearing temperatures, and require heat to thrive and grow.<br>
                            
                            A very interesting fact about air plants is that they have no stems or true roots. Their roots do not do much absorbing at all like a typical, ground dwelling plant. They are used to firmly anchor the Tillandsia to a branch or other structure. Instead of absorbing nutrients through their roots, they absorb nutrients through their leaves. Some of the nutrients come from decaying insect and plant material that runs off and onto the leaves of the air plant. They take in nutrients very gradually. If these plants take in too many nutrients at one time, the plant will actually get poisoned and die! Because of their slow intake, their growth is also very slow.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Light</h6>
                            <p>Air plants should be kept where they'll receive bright, indirect sunlight or under fluorescent home/office lighting. Periods of direct sunlight are just fine, but more than a few hours of hot sun will deplete the plants of their moisture. If your plant will be in a spot with some pretty direct light, try misting them every couple of days to keep them hydrated.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Water</h6>
                            <p>Air plants live on air, right? Uh, not right! While air plants don't grow in soil, they definitely NEED to be watered. While the plants can survive for long periods of drought, they will not grow or thrive and will eventually die off if water is too scarce. Follow the directions below for watering your plants on a regular basis and they will stay alive and well for quite some time. The good news is that since these plants are very forgiving, you shouldn't stress over their care schedule. There's certainly no need to get a babysitter when you go on vacation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>How do I water my Air Plants?</h6>
                            <p>As a main method of watering your plants, we recommend giving them a thorough rinsing under running water or letting them soak in a bath of water for 20-30 minutes. You can use a bowl, the sink or even the bathtub if you've got a family. After their shower or bath, gently shake the plants to remove any excess water from the base and the leaves, and set out to dry in an area with enough air circulation to dry them out in about 4 hours. If your plants need an in-between watering, misting them with a spray bottle is a great method. A plant in bloom should be rinsed rather than submerged in water, and take care when rinsing the delicate flowers.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>How often do i water my Air Plants?</h6>
                            <p>Your plants should be watered once per week, and 2-3 times is recommended for optimal care. A longer, 2-hour soak is recommended every 2-3 weeks. If you are in a drier, hotter climate, more frequent watering or misting will be needed. You'll begin to notice that after watering, your plant's leaves will feel stiffer and full of water and they'll be softer and lighter in color when they're in need of water. Wrinkled or rolled leaves can be a sign of dehydration.

                        <li>
                            <h6>Temperature</h6>
                            <p><strong>Air plants will do best in generally warm conditions (a good range is 50-90 degrees).</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Grooming | Maintenance</h6>
                            <p>It is normal for some of the lower leaves of your tillandsias to dry out as the plant grows or acclimates to a new environment, and those leaves can be gently pulled right off of the plant. If the leaf tips have dried out, you can snip the dried tip off (try trimming at an angle to leave a natural-looking pointy tip), and the same can be done for the plant's roots. Don't worry about harming your plants during grooming--they'll regrow.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Feeding your Air Plants</h6>
                            <p>Fertilizing your plants is not necessary, but will keep them in top shape and should promote blooming and reproduction. We recommend using our Grow More Air Plants and Bromedliad Fertilizer once per month. Other water-soluble fertilizers can be used at 1/4 strength.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h6>Blooming</h6>
                            <p>Air plants are tropical plants that usually live for several years and will bloom and produce flowers only one time during their lifetime. The flowers are striking and brilliantly colored, and the bloom period will last several days to many months, depending on the species. Different species bloom at different times, also depending on their care and environment. A plant will most likely go into bloom sometime between mid-winter and mid-summer.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Pups</h6>
                            <p>Around a plant's bloom time, they'll produce offshoots, or "pups." You'll notice the pups have a separate and distinct center of their own, distinguishing them from the other leaves. Once the pup reaches at least one-third the size of the parent plant, the pup can be removed by gently pulling it apart from the parent. Hold both the parent and the pup at their bases and gently twist in a downward motion. You can also cut the plants apart using a clean razor blade, slicing as far down the pup stem as possible. Each pup will follow the lifecycle by growing into a parent plant, blooming and producing pups of it's own.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Clumping</h6>
                            <p>Air plants can grow into clumps if the pups are left to grow on the parent plant. Clumps can also be created by wiring multiple plants together, as they'll begin to grow into and around each other.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Mounting</h6>
                            <p>Since air plants are very unique in that they do not require soil to grow and thrive, they can be mounted to almost any different surface for display. We recommend using the base of the plant as the mounting area. Adhesives like E-6000, Liquid Nails, Goop or a hot glue gun will work great, as well as fishing line or any non-copper wire. When choosing your mounting surface, remember that your plant will still need to be watered, so something waterproof or water-resistant will be the best choice for a long-term display method.
                            </p>

                    <p>The spider plant or Chlorophytum comosum is one of the easiest air plants to grow, and it’s also one of the best for air purification.
                        The plant is durable and adaptable, so can be a good air plant for your bedroom, bathroom, or just anywhere else in your home.
                        The spider plant owes its name to its spiderettes, or the small plants sprouting from the mother plant. These spiderettes can become spider plants themselves.<br>
                        <strong><i>Important:</i></strong><i>This plant is more terrestrial than aerial, however, so the caring routine for it is more similar to that of plants growing in soil than hanging ones.</i>
