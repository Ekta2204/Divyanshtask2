            <h5>Indoor Plants Care </h5>
            <p>A houseplant is a plant that is grown indoors in places such as residences and offices, mainly for
                decorative purposes, but studies have also shown them to have positive psychological effects.</p>
            <p>The first thing to consider when selecting a houseplant is where you want to put it. Then match the space
                and lighting with the plant's requirements. Do you have a big spot by a sunny window or a small space
                with moderate light?
                Next ask yourself if you are looking for a plant with beautiful green leaves or would prefer a flowering
                plant. Some flowering houseplants are seasonal while others will bloom year after year.
                A third consideration is how much time you can devote to a particular plant. A spider plant will take
                almost any amount of care (or neglect), while an orchid requires significant tender, loving care.</p>

                        <h5>Watering | Things to look out for</h5>
                        <p>Potting soil should be kept moist, but not wet. Of course, there are always exceptions —
                            succulents, and other thick-leafed plants do best when the soil dries out between watering. If
                            the soil is kept too dry or too damp the plant’s roots will begin to die, which can lead to
                            inadequate growth or even death of the plant.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Dehydration</h5>
                        <p>Do <strong><mark>NOT</mark></strong> let plants get to the point where they are wilting or the soil is pulling
                            away from the edge of the container. These symptoms indicate dehydration and at this point the
                            plant is already seriously stressed and the roots may be damaged.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Slow Leaf growth</li>

                        <h4>Wondering what is the proper way to water?</h4>
                        <h5>Water Quality</h5>
                        <p>Room temperature tap water should be fine for most indoor plants, even if there is chlorine or fluoride added to your city’s water. Plants especially love rainwater or melted snow (unless you live in a region with acid rain). Avoid continuous use of softened water, which may contain sodium.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h5>How to Water</h5>
                        <p>Plants can be watered from the top down or bottom up. When watering from the top, try not to wet the foliage, while ensuring the entire soil mass is moistened. Water should be coming out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.
                            If you prefer to let your plants do the work, set the plant in a dish of water and the roots (and capillary action in the soil) will pull up whatever they need. This method, known as bottom-watering, is a more thorough, if time-consuming, way to water plants.<br><br>
                        <mark><strong>Tip:</strong>Be sure to dump any standing water from the saucer one hour after watering!</mark>
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h5>Drainage</h5>
                        <p>Good drainage is essential to healthy houseplants. Start with a good, organic potting soil (not regular soil) that has been mixed specifically for indoor gardening.
                            Choose a container with drainage holes, or put a layer of pebbles in the bottom of a container without holes. The point is to not let the plant stand in water. From time to time, check that the drainage holes have not been clogged. And always empty standing water (don’t run it back through the plant’s soil).</p>

                    <h5>Fertilizing House Plants</h5>
                    <p>Never try to equate fertilizing with feeding. Plants get their energy from light, not fertilizers. Unless good light levels are supplied and the plant is growing well, fertilizing will do more harm than good. Newly purchased or repotted house plants should be given a few months rest from feeding so that they can use up the nutrients already present in their growing mix.
                        Every time a plant is watered nutrients leach out of the soil. Even if that didn’t happen, plants would quickly deplete the nutrients in their soil. Unlike plants living outside, houseplants don’t have a regular source of nutrient replenishment unless you fertilize them regularly. (Newly purchased plants have been heavily fertilized in the greenhouse and can wait a few weeks before getting started on a fertilizing regime.)
                        Fertilize once a month when plants are flowering or growing. During the winter, when plants are dormant or generally not growing much, fertilizer can be withheld.
                        If a plant is dropping its lower leaves, showing weak growth or an overall yellow-green color, it may need more fertilizer. It might also need more light or less water, so take the time to analyze all conditions before pouring on more plant food. Adding fertilizer when a plant does not need it can be worse than doing nothing at all.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h5>Constant Feed Method</h5>
                    <p>One way to make sure your house plants get the fertilizer they need is to use a constant feed method.
                        Simply take a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer designed for a monthly application and reduce its dosage by four. For example, if the label states it should be applied once a month at a rate of one teaspoon per gallon, apply it at every watering at a rate of ¼ teaspoon per gallon. Once a month, take the plant to the sink and leach it carefully by running clear water through its pot until the excess fertilizer runs into the drain. This helps prevent buildup.
                        Tip: If a plant is wilted, water well first then apply a fertalizer later - after it has recovered.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h5>Inorganic Vs. Organic Fertalizers</h5>
                    <p>Both organic and inorganic fertilizers provide plants with the nutrients needed to grow healthy and strong. However, each contains different ingredients and supplies these nutrients in different ways. Organic fertilizers work over time to create a healthy growing environment, while inorganic fertilizers provide rapid nutrition. Determining which is better for your plants depends largely on the needs of your plants and your preferences in terms of cost and environmental impact.Fertilizers supplement the soil with macronutrients needed in large amounts: nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. However, organic and inorganic fertilizers do so via different materials. Organic fertilizers contain only plant- or animal-based materials that are either a byproduct or end product of naturally occurring processes, such as manures, leaves, and compost.</p>

                            <p>Inorganic fertilizer, also referred to as synthetic fertilizer, is manufactured artificially and contains minerals or synthetic chemicals. For example, synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are typically made from petroleum or natural gas. Phosphorus, potassium and other trace elements in inorganic fertilizers are often mined from the earth. Balanced inorganic fertilizers, high in all three macronutrients, commonly include products like ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, potassium chloride (potash), triple superphosphate, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts).</p>

                            </summary>
                            <p>Organic fertilizers release nutrients only when the soil is warm and moist, which tends to correspond with your plants’ times of greatest need. However, they rely on soil organisms to break down organic matter, so nutrients are released more slowly than they are from inorganic fertilizers. This slow-release method reduces the risk of nutrient leaching, but it takes time to supply nutrients to plants. In contrast, inorganic fertilizers provide this nutrition in plant-ready form immediately. However, the concentration of nutrients increases the risk of burning the plant, and the rapid release of nutrients may leach them deeply into the soil and water table where plants can't access them.</p>

                    <h5>Major Elements for healthy growth</h5>
                    <p>Plants require three major elements for healthy growth: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These are always listed on fertilizer labels in the form of ratios: 6-12-4, for example, indicates 6 percent nitrogen, 12 percent phosphorus, and 4 percent potassium. Most fertilizers also contain some of the minor elements -- magnesium, boron, iron, etc. -- that plants also need for growth.
                        Generally speaking, fertilizers rich in nitrogen (the first number) will stimulate healthy, green growth of foliage, while those rich in phosphorus (the second number) will encourage good root development and improved flowering. Those rich in potassium (the third number) will help build up reserves for plants that have a dormant period.
                        A fertilizer labeled 30-20-20 would be good for leaf development and would be most recommended for foliage house plants, while flowering house plants would prefer one richer in phosphorus, such as 15-30-15. Most foliage house plants get along fine with an all-purpose or high-nitrogen fertilizer, while one with a high proportion of phosphorus is best for flowering house plants.
                        
                        </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Potting House Plants</h5>
                    <p>Repot house plants at least once a year, preferably in the spring. Fast-growing house plants may require repotting two or more times a year.
                        One sign that a house plant needs repotting is when it begins to wilt only a few days after a thorough watering. House plants should also be repotted when they threaten to tip over (put these into clay pots or use a heavy potting mix). When a white or yellowish crust begins to build up on the plant’s stem and pot rim, indicating an excess of mineral salts, it is also time to repot.
                        House plants that are difficult or impossible to repot -- a tree-sized plant, for example -- should be top-dressed annually. This simply means scraping off the top inch of potting mix and replacing it with new mix. This procedure will help remove any toxic mineral salts that have built up.
                        
                        </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>How to Repot</h5>
                    <p>Tip the plant upside down, holding its stem and rootball firmly. If it does not slide out on its own, run a knife around the inside of the pot to loosen the rootball. With a pencil or your finger, remove up to one third of the original potting mixture from all around the rootball, gently teasing it loose. Trim off any dead or damaged roots. For repotting, choose a clean pot no more than one or two sizes larger than the previous one. If the plant has reached its full size, don’t increase the pot size. Pour enough potting mix into the bottom of the new pot to bring the plant up to its original height. Center it well and fill in the empty space with growing mix. A thorough watering will help the plant adjust to its new home.
                        Newly repotted house plants should be kept out of bright sun for a week or two.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Potting Mixes For House Plants</h5>
                    <p>Most house plants thrive in ready-made all-purpose potting mixes. Most modern mixes are soilless, made of peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite in various proportions. They are light and well aerated, yet hold moisture well, making them ideal for plant growth.
                        Asparagus ferns, caladiums, Boston ferns, and many other plants prefer this potting mix. Soil-based mixes are heavier and drain more rapidly. They make good choices for cacti and succulents.
                        Finally, certain indoor plants, such as cattleya orchids and Venus’s fly-traps, normally grow on trees in the wild and require very well-aerated mixes. They are often grown in fast-draining mixes such as sphagnum moss, bark chips, or special epiphyte mixes.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Improving Your Potting Soil</h5>
                    <p>Take these steps to ensure your plants have the soil they need:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repot every year. This is probably the easiest and most practical of all options. The fact is, the vast majority of people grow in peat-based bagged soils, and that's probably not going to change anytime soon. But for the sake of your plants, repot every year and you'll have healthier, more productive plants.</li>
                        <li>Improve your bagged soil. It's not a long-term fix, but you can improve on peat-based growing mixes by mixing in a few handfuls of perlite. It won't slow the decomposition rate of the peat, but it will increase aeration.</li>
                        <li>Flush the soil thoroughly every month, at a minimum. Take the plant to the kitchen sink or outside and thoroughly flush the soil to wash out accumulated salts from fertilizer and deposits from tap water.
                        </li>

                    <h5>Lighting</h5>
                    <p>As with watering, every plant has different light requirements. Many plants prefer direct sunlight, but this may be hard to get inside a house. Placing a plant in a window might offer enough light, but some houseplants will need supplementing from a grow light.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Where should I place my houseplants?</h5>
                    <p>A dimly lit room should suffice for those few plants willing to survive in low light areas. Moderate light-needing plants will prefer a north-facing window, light diffused through a thin curtain or daylight without direct sun. Indoor plants that prefer high light will need to be in a south-facing window or under a grow light.
                        South-facing windows provide the brightest conditions for the longest amount of time, making them most suitable for plants that need bright and direct sunlight. In winter, any plant will benefit from a position near a southern window, but low-light loving plants may get sunburned by the bright light in late spring, summer or early fall.
                        East and west windows, on the other hand, suit many plants in the medium light range. Only plants requiring low light levels or no direct sunlight should be placed by north-facing windows.
                        North facing windows. These windows tend to have the weakest light intensity and are often in relatively deep shade throughout the window. It may be possible to grow shade-loving plants in a north-facing window during the summer months, but in the winter, these windows are usually not conducive to plant growth.
                        How close to a window you place your plant also matters. While distance varies, It is recommend putting a plant 3 to 10 feet away from a windowsill.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>What other factors might affect the amount of light my house plant gets?
                    </h5>
                    <p>Some decorating choices you make may also affect how much sunlight your houseplants receive. Light-colored or reflective surfaces on the walls and floor will increase the intensity of light available to your plants, while darker surfaces decrease light intensity.
                        If you want to add a sun-loving Bird of Paradise in your living room, consider painting your room a lighter color or hanging a mirror opposite a window to up the light intensity. For plants that flourish in low light, consider a darker shade for your walls or investing in some thick curtains to block light.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Foliage Plants</h5>
                    <p>Foliage plants can be divided into three categories: those requiring low light, moderate light and high light.
                        Inadequate light can cause plants to have spindly stems, yellow foliage and leaf drop, while too much can lead to leaf burn or pale foliage. One of the best ways to avoid these outcomes is to consider the natural flow of sunlight coming through your windows.</p>

                    <h5>Temperature</h5>
                    <p>Almost all house plants come from tropical and subtropical climates with temperatures very much like those in our homes. A daytime temperature range of anywhere from 65° to 75°F (18° to 24°C) is just perfect for them, and most plants have no trouble tolerating occasional summertime highs of up to 90°F (32°C).
                        Generally speaking, indoor temperatures that you find acceptable will also be just fine for healthy growth of your house plants.
                        Even tropical plants like cooler air at night than during the day. As a result, healthier growth will be seen if temperatures drop 5° to 10°F (3° to 5°C) at night. Night temperatures naturally drop indoors, especially near windows.
                        Such cooler night temperatures are not only good for house plants and humans, they also help conserve energy.
                        Long periods of extreme heat can be harmful to house plants. You can increase ventilation through screened windows or a fan. Air conditioning will also help bring temperatures down to acceptable levels, but house plants should not be put directly in the path of cold drafts. Since humidity is removed from the air through air conditioning, some means of increasing humidity may be necessary, especially in dry climates.

                        <h5>Humidity</h5>
                        <p>Most plants thrive in high humidity — around 80%. Unfortunately, most homes are much drier, especially in the winter when forced heat can even further drop the humidity.<br>

                            Using a humidifier can help, but there are other ways to increase the moisture in the air near your plants. A small tray containing pebbles and water can boost local humidity as can grouping plants more closely together. Daily misting of the plant’s leaves can help as well. For some plants, such as gardenias and orchids, keeping them in a bathroom or the kitchen (both usually have a higher humidity) can help.</p>
